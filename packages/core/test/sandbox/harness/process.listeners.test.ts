 * paths that leak it never fires, because `abort` is one-shot and has already fired. It is

 * watches — and watches through the runtime's own collection rather than around it, since a

/**
 * Which listeners a signal is left carrying, which is a leak nothing else here would notice.
 *
 * Wrapping the instance's own `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` rather than counting
 * kills, because the two questions are different: a listener that is never removed still never
 * fires — `abort` is one-shot, and on the paths that leak it has already fired — so it costs
 * nothing observable per spawn and everything cumulatively.
 *
 * The wrapper around the callback is what makes `live` mean the runtime rather than this
 * helper's own bookkeeping. `{ once: true }` collection does *not* go through
 * `removeEventListener` — it is internal to the `EventTarget`, measured under Bun 1.3.14: a
 * wrapped `removeEventListener` records zero calls after a once-listener fires, and the
 * listener is genuinely gone (a second `dispatchEvent` does not re-run it). A set built from
 * add-minus-remove therefore keeps reporting a listener the signal no longer holds, which is a
 * green assertion resting on a fixture that mis-models the runtime — coverage that is not
 * there (cubic review, PR #274; its stated mechanism was that `once` calls
 * `removeEventListener`, which it does not, but the conclusion holds for this reason).
 *
 * So the map is keyed by the caller's own function and holds the wrapper actually attached:
 * firing under `once` drops the entry, exactly as the runtime drops the listener, and
 * `removeEventListener(original)` still finds the wrapper to take off. A removal aimed at some
 * other* function still cannot pass as a removal of this one.
