/**
 * The sandbox surface the orchestrator actually runs against.
 *
 * These types are *structural copies* of the `@cloudflare/sandbox` shapes, not imports of
 * them, and that is the whole point of the package. Importing them would make every future
 * backend — e2b, Daytona, a local container — depend on the Cloudflare SDK to describe a
 * process it never runs there. Copying them keeps the contract free of any one vendor while
 * staying structurally assignable from the Cloudflare types, so `@cloudflare/sandbox`'s own
 * `ISandbox` satisfies {@link SandboxSession} with no mapping layer at all (see
 * `sandbox-cloudflare.ts`). A non-Cloudflare backend pays the mapping cost; the incumbent
 * pays nothing.
 *
 * The surface is deliberately the *used* one, not the full one. `ISandbox` carries ~20
 * methods and `SandboxProcess` nine; the orchestrator calls ten of them between the two.
 * Everything omitted here — `writeFile`, `mkdir`, `createTerminal`, `waitForPort`,
 * `output`, `waitForLog` — is absent because no caller in `apps/cf-orchestrator/src/run`
 * reaches for it, and a contract that declares unused methods bills every backend for
 * implementing them. Widen it when a caller appears, not before.
 *
 * One asymmetry is worth stating, because it is why this contract exists rather than
 * `Experimental_SandboxSession` from `@ai-sdk/provider-utils`: the AI SDK's sandbox session
 * has no process-reattachment primitive. Its `SandboxProcess` hands back live `stdout` and
 * `stderr` streams and an optional `pid`, and nothing that resolves a process id back into a
 * handle. The run workflow's durability is built on exactly that — `getProcess(id)` plus
 * `logs({ replay: true })` is how a retried step re-reads a turn's output from the
 * beginning (AC-015). A contract without it cannot express what this orchestrator already
 * does, so the AI SDK shape is a peer of this one, not its parent.

/**
 * Bounds on a wait — never on the process.
 *
 * A wait that ends before the process does **rejects**; it never resolves. That is not a
 * stylistic preference, it is what every caller is already written against: in
 * `run-workflow.ts` the `catch` around `waitForExit` *is* the timeout path — `killTurn`
 * treats it as "the kill was not confirmed", `materializationExit` as "kill the clone and
 * fail the step". A backend that resolves instead silently converts "I stopped watching"
 * into "it is dead", and the caller then proceeds over a process that is still running:
 * a clone racing the retry over the same tree, or a second `claude` turn on the same repo.
 *
 * So a resolved {@link ProcessExit} always describes a process that actually exited, and
 * `timedOut` on it means the *process* was killed by its own timeout — not that the caller
 * gave up. `@cloudflare/sandbox` already behaves this way (`ProcessWaitTimeoutError`); a
 * rejection carrying {@link SandboxWaitTimeoutError} is this contract's spelling of it, so
 * a caller can tell an expired wait from an arbitrary transport failure.
 *
 * `timeout` is what makes a wait expirable, and a backend may not invent one:
 *
 * - **with `timeout`** — the wait rejects with {@link SandboxWaitTimeoutError} once the
 *   budget elapses;
 * - **without `timeout`** — the wait does not expire, and
 *   {@link SandboxWaitTimeoutError} is unreachable. It may still reject for a reason the
 *   backend actually observed, such as finding the process gone with no exit recorded.
 *
 * That second case is a property callers rely on, not a gap left to each backend's taste:
 * `awaitTurn` in `run-workflow.ts` races an unbounded `waitForExit()` inside a step that
 * allows a live turn six hours and is never retried, so a private cap in one backend does
 * not bound a wait — it fails the run for a turn that was merely long.

 * {@link SandboxNoExitRecordError}: the process is already gone and recorded no exit. Waiting
 * again buys nothing; the caller reports the failure.

 * `@cloudflare/sandbox` throws its own `ProcessWaitTimeoutError`, which is a genuine timeout
