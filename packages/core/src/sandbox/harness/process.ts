 * `run` and `spawn` over the contract's `exec`, and the stream split that makes them fit.
 *
 * Two shapes disagree here. The harness passes a **shell string**; `SandboxCommand` is argv,
 * deliberately — `claude-argv.ts` depends on no shell being involved. So the shell is named
 * explicitly, `['sh', '-c', command]`, which puts the whole command in one argv element. A
 * backend that has to render argv back into a shell word list quotes each element
 * conservatively (`packages/sandbox-e2b/src/shell-quote.ts`), and the wrapping survives that:
 * `quoteArgv(['sh', '-c', `echo 'hi' && printf "%s\n" $HOME; false`])` renders
 * `'sh' '-c' 'echo '\''hi'\'' && printf "%s\n" $HOME; false'`, which run through `sh -c`
 * prints `hi` and the expanded `$HOME` and exits 1 — the operators, the nested quotes and the
 * exit code all intact (measured against `shell-quote.ts` on 2026-08-25).
 *
 * And the harness wants `stdout` and `stderr` as two byte streams, while the contract hands
 * back one `ReadableStream<ProcessLogEvent>` with the source tagged per event. The split is
 * written here rather than imported from `apps/cf-orchestrator/src/run/process-ndjson.ts`:
 * that one is app code and carries semantics this surface has no business inheriting — a
 * side channel of exit codes and truncation notices, and a bounded stderr tail.

  //
  // Abort handling here is two guards: `throwIfAborted()` above, for a signal aborted before
  // `spawn` was entered, and this listener, for one that fires after it is attached. Whatever
  // sits between them is a window, and `await exec` is a remote call, so the window is wide in
  // wall-clock terms. `abort` is one-shot, so a listener attached after the fact never runs —
  // the same DOM behaviour the pre-check exists for. An abort landing in the window therefore
  // left the command running in the sandbox with no kill ever issued, while `wait()` still
  // rejected with the reason: the caller was told it had cancelled something that was in fact
  // still running. That is the second instance of this one bug class on this path.
  //
  // Attaching first cannot fire for an abort that already happened, so it only ever covers
  // forwards; the `aborted` read then covers everything backwards to the pre-check, and there
  // is no `await` between the two lines for an abort to slip into. Check-then-attach would
  // reopen a smaller version of the same window instead of closing it.
  //
  // Killing and then throwing the reason keeps the contract the pre-check already set: a
  // caller that aborted gets a rejection, never a live process it holds no handle for.
  //
  // The pre-check calls the listener's own closure rather than awaiting a kill of its own,
  // and that is the whole difference between starting the cleanup and waiting for it.
  // `kill()` is an RPC into the sandbox, so a backend slow or stuck there would hold the
  // rejection back for as long as it hung — this guard's own bug class, a call outliving the
  // signal that cancelled it, reintroduced by the line that refuses the call. Nothing reads
  // the outcome either way, since `bestEffort` discards both the value and the failure, so
  // the wait bought only the delay. A listener cannot await at all, which is why the two
  // halves of one guard disagreed about one call until they were the same call (#273).
  //
  // What that costs, stated rather than left for a reader to find: under workerd a promise
  // that is neither awaited nor handed to `waitUntil` is cancelled when the request's I/O
  // context is torn down, so a handler returning right after this rejection could cancel the
  // kill before it lands — the leak this guard exists to close, arriving by another route.
  // Awaiting is still not the answer, because it reinstates the hang above and because the
  // listener has floated since #268 and cannot do otherwise; the answer is a `waitUntil`-style
  // hook on {@link ProcessSurfaceOptions}, which needs a caller to thread one from and this
  // package has none yet. Named here so the next reader inherits the trade-off, not just the

/**
 * Subscribe to the process log, killing the command if the subscription never opens.
 *
 * Third window, same bug class as the two in {@link startProcess}, reached from the other
 * side: `exec` has returned, so the command *is* running, and a rejection here propagates out
 * of `spawn` with no handle for the caller to kill it with. Nothing else would ever kill it —
 * the caller believes the spawn failed, and the sandbox outlives the call. So the failure
 * kills first and then rethrows: the kill is best-effort (a kill that failed too would
 * otherwise replace "the log stream never opened" with its own error and send the caller
 * after the wrong call), and the cause is the one worth having — except for a caller that
 * aborted, whose own reason is, per the last paragraph below.
 *
 * And the fifth window, which is this `await` — the last one `spawn` has left, and the first
 * where the leak the other four guards exist for cannot happen. {@link startProcess}'s
 * listener is attached before this call and `abort` fires it, so an abort landing here does
 * kill the command; what neither that listener nor `wait()`'s guard touches is the call
 * `spawn` is suspended in. Hence the two halves added here, and nothing more:
 *
 * - the `signal`, because a subscription opened without one has nothing to cancel it. The
 *   listener kills the process, this promise stays pending, and `spawn()` never settles for a
 *   caller that has already cancelled — a hang, not a leak, which is why no existing guard
 *   sees it. `ProcessLogsOptions.signal` is on the contract, so it costs a field.
 * - the recheck, because a backend may ignore that signal, and even one that honours it can
 *   lose the race to an abort landing after `logs()` resolved. Returning then hands the caller
 *   a process whose command the listener has just killed, where an abort one millisecond
 *   earlier — either of the windows above — would have rejected. The subscription is released
 *   (nobody will read it) and the reason thrown; the kill is deliberately *not* repeated,
 *   because the listener already issued it (codex review, PR #268).
 *
 * Whether the cleanup is waited on turns on who is waiting, which is why the `catch` branches
 * on the signal and the recheck does not.
 *
 * For a caller that has cancelled — the recheck, and the `catch`'s aborted branch — the
 * cleanup is started and never waited on, for the reason {@link startProcess}'s pre-check
 * gives: `kill()` and `cancel()` are RPCs into the sandbox, and awaiting one hands a hung
 * backend the power to delay a rejection that caller is already owed.
 *
 * For a caller that has *not* — the `catch`'s other branch — the kill is awaited, and the
 * answer is re-read afterwards, since a caller can abort inside a wait that is an RPC. The
 * ordering the await buys is the point rather than the outcome. `bestEffort` discards the outcome
 * either way, but awaiting still guarantees the kill has been issued *before* the failure
 * reaches a caller that is still waiting for a result and may retry the moment it arrives.
 * `sandbox-e2b` pins exactly that ordering one layer down — `kill() does not resolve until the
 * walk has actually reaped the process`, whose comment names the retry that would otherwise
 * clone into the same checkout while the previous process tree was still being killed (codex
 * and cubic reviews, PR #260). Nothing is racing a rejection here that nobody asked for, so
 * the delay costs the caller nothing it did not already spend on the failed `logs()` call
 * (codex review, PR #274).
 *
 * The `catch` restores the reason for the same purpose {@link waitForProcessExit}'s does: once
 * the signal is forwarded, an abort surfaces here as whatever the backend raises for a
 * cancelled read, and a caller handed that cannot recognise its own abort.
