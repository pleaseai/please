/**
 * The harness's file surface over {@link SandboxSession}'s.
 *
 * Three differences have to be reconciled, and each one is a decision rather than a rename:
 *
 * - **Absence.** The contract's `readFile` rejects when the path is not there; the harness's
 *   reads answer `null`. The contract's own note names the fix — "callers wanting
 *   absence-as-value pair it with `exists`" — so every read here is an `exists` followed by a
 *   read. It costs a round trip and buys the harness's documented shape. The two calls can
 *   also disagree, and {@link readingAbsence} is where that is handled.
 * - **Parent directories.** The harness says of all three writes that they create parent
 *   directories recursively. The contract's `writeFile` promises nothing of the kind, and
 *   whether a given backend's does is not something this package can establish for backends
 *   it has never run against. So the `mkdir` is unconditional; a redundant recursive `mkdir`
 *   costs one call, a missing one loses the write.
 * - **Encodings.** The contract's write takes `string | ReadableStream<Uint8Array>` and names
 *   only UTF-8 and base64, so bytes go out as base64 and a text encoding the platform cannot
 *   produce is refused rather than silently written as UTF-8. Reads have no such limit —
 *   they decode the raw bytes with `TextDecoder`, which handles every label the harness's
 *   `encoding` option might name.
 *
 * `abortSignal` is honoured, and what it can promise differs between the two halves:
 *
 * - **A read never outlives the signal.** Every awaited sandbox call is bracketed by a
 *   `throwIfAborted()` — before it, so none is started after the caller has cancelled, and
 *   after it, before anything is decided from what it answered. The second half is what makes
 *   the claim true of *absence* as well: a read that leaves through `return null` has decided
 *   something on the caller's behalf, and "it is not there" told to a caller that cancelled
 *   is a wrong instruction rather than a stale value. The drain, the one part with no natural
 *   end, is cancellable from the inside, so a read already running is stopped rather than
 *   waited out; and whichever way an aborted read ends — refused, cancelled, or failed by the
 *   backend as it went — the caller is handed its own reason. Nothing about a read has to be
 *   finished once it is unwanted: reading mutates nothing, so abandoning one leaves the
 *   sandbox exactly as it was.
 * - **A write already in flight is left to finish**, and that is the whole of the exclusion.
 *   The contract's `writeFile` takes no signal — only `logs()` and `waitForExit()` do — so
 *   there is nothing to forward one to, and tearing the call off part-way is what would leave
 *   a half-written file behind. That argument is about *mutation*, which is exactly why it
 *   stops at the writes and does not reach the reads. For the same reason there is no check
 *   after the final write: the mutation has landed, and reporting a cancellation for it would
 *   describe a sandbox that does not exist.
 *
 * `throwIfAborted()` throws `signal.reason`, the same value `process.ts` throws for the same
 * situation one call earlier, so a caller sees one rejection value however the abort was timed.
 *
 * One read is deliberately not symmetrical with the other two, and the difference is who owns
 * the pull loop. `readBinaryFile` and `readTextFile` drain the stream themselves, so an
 * aborted caller has no handle to stop them with and {@link bytesOf}
 * refuses on its behalf. `readFile` hands the stream back having pulled nothing: the caller
 * holds both it and the signal it aborted, and returning a handle starts no operation. So an
 * abort landing during a streaming read still yields the stream, live and uncancelled, for
 * the caller to drain or release as it chooses.

 * cancellation — reaching for `stream.cancel()` from an abort listener — throws
 * `TypeError: Invalid state: ReadableStream is locked` and leaves the outstanding `read()`
 * pending for ever; a best-effort wrapper then swallows the `TypeError` and the caller hangs
 * silently. Cancelling through the reader is the spelling that works: the pending `read()`
 * resolves `{ done: true }`, this loop falls out, and the reason is thrown (all measured
 * under Bun 1.3.14).
 *
 * Three things are needed and each covers a distinct failure:
 *
 * - the **pre-check**, because a listener attached to an already-aborted signal never fires —
 *   `abort` is one-shot, the same DOM behaviour `process.ts` guards for twice — so a caller
 *   that aborted before the drain began would otherwise be served a full read;
 * - the **listener**, because an abort landing after that check has nothing else to stop a
 *   pull that is already outstanding, which is the difference between a slow read and one
 *   that never settles;
 * - the **post-loop check**, because a cancelled drain ends the way a complete one does. Two
 *   lines of a file the caller stopped wanting, returned as if they were the file, is the
 *   worst of the three outcomes: it is not an error the caller can see.
 *
 * The cancels are best-effort so a stream that fails to release cannot replace the caller's
 * own abort reason with a teardown error — the reason `bestEffort` exists. They are also
 * started rather than waited on, which is why the pre-check calls the listener's own
 * `release` instead of awaiting a cancel of its own: `cancel()` runs the backend's teardown,
 * and a backend that hangs there would hold the rejection back for exactly as long as it
 * hung. That is this function's own bug — a read outliving the signal that cancelled it —
 * reintroduced in the line that refuses the read. Nothing waits on the outcome either way,
 * since `bestEffort` discards it, so awaiting bought only the delay (codex review, PR #272).
