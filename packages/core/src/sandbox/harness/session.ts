/**
 * One {@link HarnessV1NetworkSandboxSession} over one contract sandbox.
 *
 * The infra surface is where the two models diverge most, and each divergence is settled
 * here rather than pushed onto a backend:
 *
 * - **Ports are asked of the provider, not the session.** The contract puts `portEndpoint`
 *   on `SandboxProvider` on purpose — `SandboxSession` is satisfied by
 *   `@cloudflare/sandbox`'s own client with no mapping layer, and one added method would end
 *   that. So this session closes over the provider and its id.
 * - **`stop` and `destroy` are the same call.** The contract has one `destroy()`. The harness
 *   requires both to be idempotent and to survive an already-stopped sandbox, so a *successful*
 *   teardown is latched and concurrent callers share the one in flight. A failed one is not:
 *   a rejected promise left in the latch is replayed by every later call without ever
 *   reaching the backend again, so one transient RPC error would outlive itself and leave the
 *   sandbox unreapable for the life of the session. That is the bug `lazySession` already
 *   fixed once — "Memoise the acquisition, not its failure"
 *   (`packages/sandbox-e2b/src/provider.ts`, codex review, PR #260). Retrying is safe by the
 *   harness's own rule that `destroy` must handle an already-stopped sandbox, so a redundant
 *   second `destroy()` after a partial first is the right trade against a leaked sandbox.
 * - **`restricted()` is a separate object**, not this one narrowed by a type. The harness
 *   hands that view to user-tool `execute()` calls; a tool that reaches past the declared
 *   type must find nothing there, not a working `stop`.
